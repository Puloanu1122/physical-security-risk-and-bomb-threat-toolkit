# Evacuation Decision Guide

## Purpose
Provides a structured framework for deciding whether to evacuate, shelter-in-place, or take other protective actions during a bomb threat.

## Factors to Consider
1. **Threat Credibility** (`bomb-threat-overview.md`)  
   - High, Medium, Low
2. **Location of Threat**  
   - Specific area, entire building, outdoor
3. **Time to Detonation**  
   - Immediate, within hours, unspecified
4. **Occupant Density**  
   - Number of people in the affected area
5. **Accessibility and Egress**  
   - Are evacuation routes clear and safe?

## Evacuation Decision Flow
1. **High Credibility Threat** → Immediate evacuation  
2. **Medium Credibility Threat** → Partial or controlled evacuation, monitor situation  
3. **Low Credibility Threat** → Increase security and surveillance, do not evacuate unless conditions change  

### Additional Considerations
- Use pre-designated **assembly points**  
- Avoid elevators; use stairs  
- Keep emergency services informed of movement and route  
- Assist vulnerable individuals (elderly, children, disabled)  
- Account for all personnel after evacuation

## Notes
- Decisions must be documented in **incident logs**  
- Evacuation plans must be practiced regularly (drills)  
- Review post-incident to improve procedures

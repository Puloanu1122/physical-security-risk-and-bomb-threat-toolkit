# Vulnerability Assessment

## Purpose
Vulnerability assessment identifies weaknesses in a facility’s physical security that could be exploited by threats. It is the second step in a risk-based security approach.

## Key Vulnerabilities to Assess
- **Perimeter Security:** Fencing, gates, barriers, lighting
- **Access Control:** Badge systems, locks, visitor management
- **Surveillance:** CCTV coverage, blind spots, recording retention
- **Internal Controls:** Restricted areas, staff screening, inventory control
- **Emergency Preparedness:** Fire exits, alarms, evacuation routes
- **Procedural Weaknesses:** Duty handover gaps, patrol schedules, SOP compliance

## Assessment Method
1. List all assets and critical areas
2. Inspect security controls physically
3. Identify weaknesses (missing, broken, outdated)
4. Rate severity: Low / Medium / High
5. Document findings in a **risk register** (template in `/05-templates`)

## Notes
- Vulnerabilities are dynamic; reassess periodically
- Include both physical and procedural weaknesses
- Engage multiple stakeholders for completeness

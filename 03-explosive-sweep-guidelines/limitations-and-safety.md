# Limitations and Safety Considerations

## Purpose
To define boundaries, cautions, and safety rules during high-risk explosive sweeps to protect personnel and property.

## Key Limitations
1. **No Untrained Personnel:** Only trained and authorized staff may participate  
2. **Do Not Touch Suspicious Items:** Sweep operators must report, not handle, any suspect devices  
3. **Limited Equipment:** Avoid using tools or devices that could trigger explosives unless specifically designed  
4. **Environmental Hazards:** Be aware of wet floors, unstable surfaces, electrical hazards  

## Safety Measures
- Maintain **safe distance** from suspicious objects  
- Use protective equipment (vests, gloves, helmets)  
- Follow communication protocols at all times  
- Ensure **clear evacuation routes** are accessible  
- Stop the sweep immediately if unsafe conditions arise  

## Coordination
- Maintain continuous communication with team leader  
- Liaise with law enforcement for guidance if a potential device is found  
- Document all observations and actions

## Notes
- Safety is more important than speed  
- Post-sweep review should capture lessons learned and update SOPs accordingly

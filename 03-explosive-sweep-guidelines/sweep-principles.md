# Explosive Sweep Principles

## Purpose
Provide guidance for performing safe and effective sweeps of facilities for explosive threats.

## Key Principles
1. **Safety First:** Always prioritize the safety of personnel over property.  
2. **Proximity Principle:** Maintain safe distance; do not rush towards suspicious items.  
3. **Suspicious vs Unattended Items:**  
   - Suspicious: Items that appear out of place or unusual  
   - Unattended: Items left without owner or authorization  
4. **Sweep Team Coordination:** Use clear roles, communication, and checklists.  
5. **Documentation:** Record all sweeps and findings for accountability.  

## Notes
- Only trained personnel should handle explosive sweeps  
- Always coordinate with law enforcement when a threat is suspected

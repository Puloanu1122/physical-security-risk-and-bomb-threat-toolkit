# Sweep Locations

## Purpose
Provide guidance on prioritizing and identifying locations for high-risk explosive sweeps within a facility.

## Common Sweep Locations
1. **Entrances and Exits**  
   - Main doors, emergency exits, loading docks  
   - High traffic areas where unattended items may be left  

2. **High-Value / Sensitive Areas**  
   - Server rooms, control rooms, vaults  
   - Areas critical to operations or containing sensitive data  

3. **Public and Gathering Areas**  
   - Lobbies, waiting rooms, cafeterias  
   - Places with high occupant density  

4. **Parking Lots and Perimeter Areas**  
   - Vehicles, bike racks, outdoor equipment  
   - Potential for hidden explosive devices  

5. **Back-of-House / Service Areas**  
   - Storage rooms, mechanical rooms  
   - Less monitored but accessible areas  

## Prioritization Guidelines
- Use **RAG method** (Red = High, Amber = Medium, Green = Low) for prioritizing areas  
- Begin with high-risk locations first  
- Sweep team members should follow a systematic, clockwise or grid pattern  
- Document sweep completion for each area

## Notes
- Adjust priorities based on facility type and event context  
- Reassess sweep locations after any operational or structural changes
